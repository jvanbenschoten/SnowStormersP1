This is remarkable. It’s a film that raises a lot of issues about whether fervent loyalty to the code of honour is more valuable than humanity. And how that is unjustifiable. The execution is masterful, and the pay-off is even better. The resolution is entirely cathartic. It’s also incredibly well-choreographed, touching, and surprisingly exciting. I do think that I will need another watch in order to fully digest everything, though.",500,86

So utterly brutal, just like Scene From a Marriage. Liv and Ingrid toe to toe in an epic battle of out of this world acting skills. Watch something like Cries and Whispers and see how Liv is cruel and seductive, then to Autumn Sonata where she spends so much of it meek and passive. Watch Gaslight to see Ingrid vulnerable to this, where she is cold and callus. Just two utterly outstanding performances.",440,79

I watched the 'short' 3 hour version as opposed to the 5 hour TV Miniseries. Not Bergman's best, but a must for any cinephile. Neither of the titular characters really feature in the first hour, which is just character building and scene setting, it's the final 90 minutes that really packs the punch with the usual Bergman sub themes of guilt, grief, conflict playing major roles. The segment where the children realise the horror of being kept in a nightmarish abusive home is brilliant directing. A great Christmas film.7.8/10",543,96

It's a film comprised of footsteps, whispers, minor errors, minor victories, and the celebratory rush of triumph over hardship.

I'm amazed that a movie made by the bloody Soviet Union ten years after the death of Stalin can grasp of how to make a film with a political agenda while still creating moments between people that feel genuine.

It’s just honest. Mike Leigh has made a unique film in that regard. The acting is some of the best I’ve ever seen. Brenda Blethyn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and Timothy Spall are all Oscar worthy performances that bring these characters to life. At times I would forget these are just actors saying words on a page.

Secrets & Lies is the sort of film that Hollywood not only doesn't make but can't; it's an industry that just isn't equipped to explore ordinary people in a believable way. Leigh's dismissal of the sentiment that a major American studio would have brought only bolsters the success of his film's emotional impact, and if everything feels a bit too neat and tidy at the end, it's a small price to pay for the way it makes you feel. Plus, it's really the getting there that counts: Blethyn, Spall and Jean-Baptiste are phenomenal.Previous review",590,112
