The subtle narrative never exploits the tragedy but instead makes us empathize for the kids throughout. Their innocent joy, little dreams and happiness, oblivious about the extremity of the circumstance they are in, makes it all the more harder to see them struggle, dragging one through a whole spectrum of emotions. It’s a tough slow paced mentally exhaustive watch with a 140 mins runtime, but if you can give in the time there is a lot to draw from it. Highly recommended watch.",570,96,positive,positive,0.6986674666404724,positive,570,94,0,False,0.010822510822510822,False,0,0,en,0.8105263157894737,False
